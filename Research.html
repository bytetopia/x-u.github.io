<font face="times new roman, serif">The success of a platform depends crucially on a thorough understanding of the motivations behind participation from all sides. Identifying these motivations can be a challenging task for platform designers, especially when platforms require voluntary contribution from individuals. One motivation that those platforms have largely ignored is career incentives. In this paper, we show that career concerns play an important role in user contributions to Stack Overflow, the largest online programmer community. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that the event of finding a new job implies a reduction of 25% in reputation-generating activity, but only a reduction of 8% in non-reputation-generating activity. We consider a series of robustness tests to tease out alternative explanations for these variations.

<font face="times new roman, serif">This paper presents a dynamic model of price competition between two networks in which consumers value local network effects. Specifically, each consumerâ€™s utility level depends on the number of her neighbors in the same network. Consumers in different neighborhoods choose their networks, and each network competes for new customers in different neighborhoods with a homogeneous entry price. I characterize equilibrium market structure with a combination of analytical and numerical solutions, and compare them to results from network effect models that are global, in which a consumer benefits from all other consumers in the same network. I provide sufficient conditions such that one firm dominants both local markets, as well as sufficient conditions that each firm is the dominant one in each local market. </font>
